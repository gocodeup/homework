#Assignment #1

### Exercise #1 - Variable Assignment

1. In the repl create a variable $age and set it equal to an integer of your age.
2. Set another variable $original_age equal $age.
3. So we have gone forward in time with the Delorean 5 years. Using an incrementer (either post or pre) add 5 years to your age and echo the results. Now echo $original_age so you see what year you were before you traveled in time.
4. Now you have gone back in time 7 years. Decrement your $age by 7 years.

### Exercise #2 - Variable Assignment by Reference

1. In your repl create a variable $score and set it equal to 75.
2. Now assign a new variable $reference_score equal to $score.
3. The team just scored 3 points so using a combined operator ( += ) add 3 points to $score. Now echo $score and echo $reference_score.

### Exercise #3 - Constants

1. Define a constant BIRTH_CITY and set it equal to your birth city.
2. Try to redefine that constant? Did you get the expected result?

### Exercise #4 - Arrays

1. Here is a list of 10 prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Save them to a an array variable $prime_numbers.
2. Please echo out the prime number 7.
3. Create an associative array $car. Set the keys for this array as: year, make, model, color, mileage. Make up the mileage part. Add other keys if you want as well.
4. Create a multidimensional array called $cars. So keys will be the owner name. (Example my key will be 'isaac')

### Git

1. Create empty reposity on github.
2. Create directory locally and change directory into it (cd).
3. Initialize git locally in this folder.
4. Add your remote reposity to this local folder.
5. Create empty file called TEST.md.
6. Add, commit and push this file up.
7. Verify that the file is online on github

### Control Structures

1. Create if_homework.php file in your exercise directory.
2. In this file create a variable called $hungry and set it to TRUE if you are hungry or FALSE if you are not.
3. Create another variable and call it $food_available and set it equal to TRUE or FALSE.
4. Create an if statement that will echo 'We are fed and good to go.' if both you have $food_available and are $hungry are true.
5. Now create another variable $have_money and set it to either TRUE or FALSE. Adjust your if statement so it reads. If you are $hungry and there is $food_available or $have_money then you will eat. If none of those are true then echo "Not hungy but thank you!"
